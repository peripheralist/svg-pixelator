# SVG Pixelator

Turns any raster image into a pixelated SVG of specified size and pixel density.

SVG width is set automatically to 400. SVG height will update to suit the height of the uploaded image.

Selecting "Force pixel size" will ensure all pixels are of the specified size, but may decrease the accuracy of the generated SVG.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
